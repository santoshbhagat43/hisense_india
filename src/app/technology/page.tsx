                  <p className="hisenseLight">
                    Hisense positioned the Laser TV as the next generation of TV, taking the lead in entering the
                    field of laser TV in 2007 and obtaining the support from the National 863 Program.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Laser TV is a disruptive and innovative product, and combines the advantages of
                    projection technology and TV technology, which has reached or even surpassed the LCD TV in
                    terms of user experience
                    and image quality. By the end of October 2018, 503 patents for laser projection were applied
                    for and 161 were authorized. 82 patents and inventions in foreign countries (United States,
                    Europe) were
                    applied for and 15 were authorized.<br />
                    <br />
                    Hisense produced the world's first 100-inch ultra short throw laser TV, 100-inch 4K ultra
                    short throw laser TV, ultra short throw dual-color laser TV and the world's first 300-inch
                    laser cinema. At
                    CES in 2019, Hisense released the 70-inch TriChroma laser TV, which is the first time for the
                    industry to test the size of laser TV to 70 inches and is also the first time to apply the
                    three-color
                    laser display technology into small- and medium-sized televisions. <br />
                    <br />
                    TriChroma laser TVs produce all colors by laser without any supplement of color wheel, almost
                    meet 100% of the BT.2020 standard and is a true three-color laser TV. Three-color laser
                    display is
                    regarded as the ultimate solution to the laser display and its color expression is better
                    than other display schemes known to mankind. Hisense has fully upgraded its display
                    performance, sound effects
                    and intelligent experience of the its laser TVs, which can meet the needs of users for all
                    scenes of large-screen audio and video products in the home. After the 80-inch laser TV was
                    marketed by
                    Hisense, it became the CMM TOP 50 model in the first week of its listing with sales exceeding
                    2,500 sets within two months, leaping to TOP 1 in the 26th week, ranking TOP 10 steadily for
                    several
                    weeks, and becoming the most eye-catching and popular product in the industry since the
                    second half of 2018. Hisense laser TV has also become the undisputed leader in the global
                    laser TV market and
                    the absolutely main force in the super-large screen TV market.

                    Limited Edition of 75-inch Hisense U9 Ultra Image Quality TV to the whole world. Hisense took
                    the lead with the backlight zone control of 1000 Zone, pushing the ULED development to a new
                    level.<br />
                    <br />
                    The ULED TV has achieved perfect image quality expression with high contrast, high color
                    gamut and high speed response, is equivalent to the OLED one in regard to color saturation
                    and contrast
                    performance and more advantageous than OLED one as far as brightness and technological
                    maturity. Compared with common LED backlight products, the ULED ones have more obvious
                    advantages, namely, the
                    contrast can be increased by more than ten times and the color gamut range has reached
                    85%BT.2020. At present, for the ULED technology, Hisense has obtained 13 invention patents
                    and successively

                  <p className="hisenseLight">
                    Hisense AI TV has been able to solve many life scenes of daily food, clothing, shelter, means
                    of traveling and entertainment for users. Smart home can be accessed via one TV. For example,
                    the TV can
                    be used to control the washing machine to "start washing clothes", control the air
                    conditioner to "adjust the certain temperature", and control the microwave oven to "start
                    baking at 8 o'clock in the
                    morning". Under such circumstances, in 2019, Hisense will set up a globally shared cloud
                    service platform in Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas, unify AI and operations and
                    establish global
                    service advantages.<br />
                    <br />
                    Many TV brands are also talking about AIOT this year, but most of them use TV as control and
                    display equipment without scene linkage and emotional transmission. The "social media"
                    attribute of TV
                    itself has been greatly ignored. Survey data show that, among the functions that young
                    netizens aged 18-24 in the United States most want to realize on TV, group games rank first
                    and chatting while
                    watching programs rank second, which also fully illustrates users' desires for social
                    functions on TV.<br />
                    <br />
                    Hisense will launch the social TV very soon to allow family members to have interactive video
                    chats at any time. The TV can be used by parents and children to reunite and communicate in
                    real time, and
                    support one-click switching of small window chat modes, so you can chat with family members
                    and friends while watching video contents. Friends can even watch movies and TV shows, cheer
                    for favorite
                    teams, play cards and sing together, and share, talk about and recommend relevant contents in
                    the Circle of Friends of TV in real time.<br />
                    <br />
                    Hisense social TV can provide real-time connection between people and people, people and
                    things, and things and things in the family scene. It is a full-scene large-screen
                    intelligent terminal with
                    social center, AIoT display control center and perception center. With its unique "social"
                    advantage, Hisense can put a dent in the AIoT era in advance. It will take this as a
                    breakthrough and
                    establish Hisense's industrial position in AIoT era based on Hisense's advantages of hardware
                    foundation and global service.

                  <p className="hisenseLight">
                    Hisense AI TV has been able to solve many life scenes of daily food, clothing, shelter, means
                    of traveling and entertainment for users. Smart home can be accessed via one TV. For example,
                    the TV can
                    be used to control the washing machine to "start washing clothes", control the air
                    conditioner to "adjust the certain temperature", and control the microwave oven to "start
                    baking at 8 o'clock in the
                    morning". Under such circumstances, in 2019, Hisense will set up a globally shared cloud
                    service platform in Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas, unify AI and operations and
                    establish global
                    service advantages.<br />
                    <br />
                    Many TV brands are also talking about AIOT this year, but most of them use TV as control and
                    display equipment without scene linkage and emotional transmission. The "social media"
                    attribute of TV
                    itself has been greatly ignored. Survey data show that, among the functions that young
                    netizens aged 18-24 in the United States most want to realize on TV, group games rank first
                    and chatting while
                    watching programs rank second, which also fully illustrates users' desires for social
                    functions on TV.<br />
                    <br />
                    Hisense will launch the social TV very soon to allow family members to have interactive video
                    chats at any time. The TV can be used by parents and children to reunite and communicate in
                    real time, and
                    support one-click switching of small window chat modes, so you can chat with family members
                    and friends while watching video contents. Friends can even watch movies and TV shows, cheer
                    for favorite
                    teams, play cards and sing together, and share, talk about and recommend relevant contents in
                    the Circle of Friends of TV in real time.<br />
                    <br />
                    Hisense social TV can provide real-time connection between people and people, people and
                    things, and things and things in the family scene. It is a full-scene large-screen
                    intelligent terminal with
                    social center, AIoT display control center and perception center. With its unique "social"
                    advantage, Hisense can put a dent in the AIoT era in advance. It will take this as a
                    breakthrough and
                    establish Hisense's industrial position in AIoT era based on Hisense's advantages of hardware
                    foundation and global service.

                    Over the years, Hisense has accumulated profound experience in image processing and display
                    technology. For its ULED TV products, Hisense has comprehensively improved core performance
                    such as screen
                    brightness, contrast, layering, dark field details and response speed through independently
                    developed ultra-quality processing technology and a new generation of "Hi View" chip. On this
                    basis, Hisense
                    has realized 4K display for its ULED TV and laser TV. At the same time, Hisense has also
                    launched U9 series TV with the most partitions and the highest degree of image refinement in
                    the world,
                    realized the 8K display and is ready for the advent of 5G era.<br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to 4k and 8K TV products, Hisense has also been continuously trying in the aspect
                    of the replacement of old growth drivers with new ones and the industrial chain expansion.
                    Hisense applied
                    4K and 8K image processing and display technologies into medical display and surgical scenes,

                    transmission are 4K system) etc. The ultra HD medical display marketing has a scale of
                    billions of yuan.<br />
                    <br />
                    Next, with the popularization of 5G technology featuring "ultra-high network speed" and
                    "ultra-low delay", the transmission of 4K and 8K ultra-high definition contents will be no
                    longer "jammed",
                    which will greatly stimulate the demands of various industries for 4K and 8K ultra-high
