                        <p class="hisenseLight">
                           Hisense positioned the Laser TV as the next generation of TV, taking the lead in entering the
                           field of laser TV in 2007 and obtaining the support from the National 863 Program.<br />
                           <br />
                           The Laser TV is a disruptive and innovative product, and combines the advantages of
                           projection technology and TV technology, which has reached or even surpassed the LCD TV in
                           terms of user experience
                           and image quality. By the end of October 2018, 503 patents for laser projection were applied
                           for and 161 were authorized. 82 patents and inventions in foreign countries (United States,
                           Europe) were
                           applied for and 15 were authorized.<br />
                           <br />
                           Hisense produced the world's first 100-inch ultra short throw laser TV, 100-inch 4K ultra
                           short throw laser TV, ultra short throw dual-color laser TV and the world's first 300-inch
                           laser cinema. At
                           CES in 2019, Hisense released the 70-inch TriChroma laser TV, which is the first time for the
                           industry to test the size of laser TV to 70 inches and is also the first time to apply the
                           three-color
                           laser display technology into small- and medium-sized televisions. <br />
                           <br />
                           TriChroma laser TVs produce all colors by laser without any supplement of color wheel, almost
                           meet 100% of the BT.2020 standard and is a true three-color laser TV. Three-color laser
                           display is
                           regarded as the ultimate solution to the laser display and its color expression is better
                           than other display schemes known to mankind. Hisense has fully upgraded its display
                           performance, sound effects
                           and intelligent experience of the its laser TVs, which can meet the needs of users for all
                           scenes of large-screen audio and video products in the home. After the 80-inch laser TV was
                           marketed by
                           Hisense, it became the CMM TOP 50 model in the first week of its listing with sales exceeding
                           2,500 sets within two months, leaping to TOP 1 in the 26th week, ranking TOP 10 steadily for
                           several
                           weeks, and becoming the most eye-catching and popular product in the industry since the
                           second half of 2018. Hisense laser TV has also become the undisputed leader in the global
                           laser TV market and
                           the absolutely main force in the super-large screen TV market.

                           texture
                           details of the image, prevents the moving pictures from blur and tailing and makes the image
                           more distinct and the details intact. At present, Hisense has established a highly vertically
                           integrated
                           industrial chain layout from the core chip to the display. Through continuous research &
                           development and iteration of image quality processing chips such as "Hi View", Hisense has
                           accumulated a large
                           amount of experience in chip research & development and manufacturing. The "8K AI Picturesque

                           of traveling and entertainment for users. Smart home can be accessed via one TV. For example,
                           the TV can
                           be used to control the washing machine to "start washing clothes", control the air
                           conditioner to "adjust the certain temperature", and control the microwave oven to "start
                           baking at 8 o'clock in the
                           morning". Under such circumstances, in 2019, Hisense will set up a globally shared cloud
                           service platform in Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas, unify AI and operations and

                           Many TV brands are also talking about AIOT this year, but most of them use TV as control and
                           display equipment without scene linkage and emotional transmission. The "social media"
                           attribute of TV
                           itself has been greatly ignored. Survey data show that, among the functions that young
                           netizens aged 18-24 in the United States most want to realize on TV, group games rank first
                           and chatting while
                           watching programs rank second, which also fully illustrates users' desires for social
                           functions on TV.<br />
                           <br />

                           Over the years, Hisense has accumulated profound experience in image processing and display
                           technology. For its ULED TV products, Hisense has comprehensively improved core performance
                           such as screen

                           developed ultra-quality processing technology and a new generation of "Hi View" chip. On this
                           basis, Hisense
                           has realized 4K display for its ULED TV and laser TV. At the same time, Hisense has also
                           launched U9 series TV with the most partitions and the highest degree of image refinement in
                           the world,
                           realized the 8K display and is ready for the advent of 5G era.<br />

                           In addition to 4k and 8K TV products, Hisense has also been continuously trying in the aspect
                           of the replacement of old growth drivers with new ones and the industrial chain expansion.
                           Hisense applied
                           4K and 8K image processing and display technologies into medical display and surgical scenes,

                           billions of yuan.<br />
                           <br />
                           Next, with the popularization of 5G technology featuring "ultra-high network speed" and
                           "ultra-low delay", the transmission of 4K and 8K ultra-high definition contents will be no

                           of traveling and entertainment for users. Smart home can be accessed via one TV. For example,
                           the TV can
                           be used to control the washing machine to "start washing clothes", control the air
                           conditioner to "adjust the certain temperature", and control the microwave oven to "start
                           baking at 8 o'clock in the
                           morning". Under such circumstances, in 2019, Hisense will set up a globally shared cloud
                           service platform in Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas, unify AI and operations and
                           establish global
                           service advantages.<br />
                           <br />
                           Many TV brands are also talking about AIOT this year, but most of them use TV as control and
                           display equipment without scene linkage and emotional transmission. The "social media"
                           attribute of TV
                           itself has been greatly ignored. Survey data show that, among the functions that young
                           netizens aged 18-24 in the United States most want to realize on TV, group games rank first
                           and chatting while
                           watching programs rank second, which also fully illustrates users' desires for social
                           functions on TV.<br />
                           <br />
                           Hisense will launch the social TV very soon to allow family members to have interactive video
                           chats at any time. The TV can be used by parents and children to reunite and communicate in
                           real time, and
                           support one-click switching of small window chat modes, so you can chat with family members
                           and friends while watching video contents. Friends can even watch movies and TV shows, cheer
                           for favorite
                           teams, play cards and sing together, and share, talk about and recommend relevant contents in
                           the Circle of Friends of TV in real time.<br />
                           <br />
                           Hisense social TV can provide real-time connection between people and people, people and
                           things, and things and things in the family scene. It is a full-scene large-screen
                           intelligent terminal with
                           social center, AIoT display control center and perception center. With its unique "social"
                           advantage, Hisense can put a dent in the AIoT era in advance. It will take this as a
                           breakthrough and
                           establish Hisense's industrial position in AIoT era based on Hisense's advantages of hardware
                           foundation and global service.

                        </h3>
                        <p class="hisenseLight">
                           Over the years, Hisense has accumulated profound experience in image processing and display
                           technology. For its ULED TV products, Hisense has comprehensively improved core performance
                           such as screen
                           brightness, contrast, layering, dark field details and response speed through independently
                           developed ultra-quality processing technology and a new generation of "Hi View" chip. On this
                           basis, Hisense
                           has realized 4K display for its ULED TV and laser TV. At the same time, Hisense has also
                           launched U9 series TV with the most partitions and the highest degree of image refinement in
                           the world,
                           realized the 8K display and is ready for the advent of 5G era.<br />
                           <br />
                           In addition to 4k and 8K TV products, Hisense has also been continuously trying in the aspect
                           of the replacement of old growth drivers with new ones and the industrial chain expansion.
                           Hisense applied
                           4K and 8K image processing and display technologies into medical display and surgical scenes,
                           and developed and launched 4K medical Consultation Display, 8MP HD Consultation Display, 4K
                           Endoscope/OR
                           Display, 4K Digital Operation imaging solution (from video capture to display and
                           transmission are 4K system) etc. The ultra HD medical display marketing has a scale of
                           billions of yuan.<br />
                           <br />
                           Next, with the popularization of 5G technology featuring "ultra-high network speed" and
                           "ultra-low delay", the transmission of 4K and 8K ultra-high definition contents will be no
                           longer "jammed",
                           which will greatly stimulate the demands of various industries for 4K and 8K ultra-high
                           definition display products and open up greater market space for Hisense TV and Hisense smart
                           medical products.
